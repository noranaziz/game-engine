# 2D game engine
## How it works
For this assignment, I created a very basic 2D game engine.
Here are the following controls:
- move "forward" (right): right arrow key
- move "backward" (left): left arrow key
- jump: space key

## Technology choices
This program was built using the programming language Python, with the help of pygame. I made sure to make mine different from the examples on canvas by letting the user only be able to control the x position of the sprite with the left and right arrow keys, and incorporated a new jump event, letting the sprite "jump" when the space bar is pressed. Other than that, the sprite is unable to move up or down.

## How to run
Make sure you have python and pygame downloaded on your device. All you have to do to run it is input the following command:
`python gameEngine.py`

A separate window should open with the game being ran.

## Lessons learned
This assignment actually taught me quite a few things, including, but not limited to:
-	OOP in python
-	loading sprite(s) in
-	motion & velocity
-	boundary detection

In my next project, I hope to expand on these principles to learn how to create more complex games.
